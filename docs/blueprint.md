## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Warm Sand (#F4A460) to evoke a sense of natural, earthy, organic materials.
- Background color: Pale Sand (#F5F5DC) to provide a soft, neutral backdrop that complements the primary color.
- Accent color: Sienna (#A0522D) to draw attention to key interactive elements. Sienna can have connotations of traditional tanneries and dyeworks, adding richness.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that is suitable for both headlines and body text, ensuring readability.
- Use clean, minimalist icons that clearly represent product categories and actions, aiding intuitive navigation. Follow the existing icon style defined in the Unica Cosm√©tiques branding guidelines.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout, emphasizing a mobile-first design approach. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter and enhance readability.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience, such as loading spinners or feedback animations upon interactions. All animations should align with the overall clean and efficient style.
